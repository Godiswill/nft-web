                    The Leopard God was born in the early chaos of the universe. At that time, the
                    universe was in a haze, nothing but endless nothingness. So the Leopard God
                    decided to create a world. He created our world with six elements in the
                    universe, namely, water, wood, sand, ice, fire and earth. Then he used these
                    elements to create oceans, forests, deserts, glaciers, lava, and the earth.
                    However, the Leopard God found that the world he created was full of
                    instability, with tsunamis, plant withering, sandstorms, heavy snow, scorching
                    sun, and earthquakes wreaking havoc on the world from time to time. Then the
                    Leopard God found the heart of the deep sea in the oceans, the heart of the
                    forest in the dark woods, the heart of the desert in the barren deserts, the
                    heart of the glacier in the severe cold glaciers, the heart of lava in the
                    roaring volcanos, and the heart of the earth in the underground caves,
                    constituting these six most precious stones in the world. He used them to make
                    six powerful supreme crowns. He stablized the world by the divine power of these
                    six supreme crowns, which helped him maintain a balanced and harmonious nature,
                    and thus made the world a paradise for life. Since then, countless lives began
                    to spring up. Human beings and animals flourished in a harmonious nature, thus
                    provided rich products, supporting countless lives. However, in the deep
                    darkness and endless nothingness, there is a pair of eyes peeping into all this.
                    It&apos;s the God of Nothingness. Much earlier than the Leopard God, the God of
                    Nothingness has long existed in this world as early as the universe came into
                    being. It existed in the endless nothingness. The God of Nothingness would erase
                    anything existed, even a speck of dust will be eliminated without a trace,
                    leaving a world of nothingness. The God of Nothingness came from nothingness to
                    the world created by Leopard God, trying to make everything disappear. But in
                    order to protect all the living beings in the world he created, the Leopard God
                    fought fiercely against the God of Nothingne

                    <p className="font-light">
                        The lucky draw system is designed to promote user transactions. In the
                        system, we have designed three kinds of awards, namely, the monthly lucky
                        draw of round leopard NFT and leopard god NFT and the Supreme Crown Award.
                        The bonuses of these awards come from the funds accumulated by the bonus
                        pool system. Since the bonus pool funds are made up of 20% mint fees and 4%
                        of each transaction fee in the secondary market, it means that the more mint
                        users and secondary market transactions, the higher the transaction fees, so
                        the more bonuses can be accumulated in the bonus pool, and then the more
                        bonuses the winners will get.
