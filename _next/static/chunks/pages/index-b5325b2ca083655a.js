At that time, the universe was in a haze, nothing but endless nothingness. So the Leopard God decided to create a world. He created our world with six elements in the universe, namely, water, wood, sand, ice, fire and earth. Then he used these elements to create oceans, forests, deserts, glaciers, lava, and the earth. However, the Leopard God found that the world he created was full of instability, with tsunamis, plant withering, sandstorms, heavy snow, scorching sun, and earthquakes wreaking havoc on the world from time to time. Then the Leopard God found the heart of the deep sea in the oceans, the heart of the forest in the dark woods, the heart of the desert in the barren deserts, the heart of the glacier in the severe cold glaciers, the heart of lava in the roaring volcanos, and the heart of the earth in the underground caves, constituting these six most precious stones in the world. He used them to make six powerful supreme crowns. He stablized the world by the divine power of these six supreme crowns, which helped him maintain a balanced and harmonious nature, and thus made the world a paradise for life. Since then, countless lives began to spring up. Human beings and animals flourished in a harmonious nature, thus provided rich products, supporting countless lives. However, in the deep darkness and endless nothingness, there is a pair of eyes peeping into all this. It's the God of Nothingness. Much earlier than the Leopard God, the God of Nothingness has long existed in this world as early as the universe came into being. It existed in the endless nothingness. The God of Nothingness would erase anything existed, even a speck of dust will be eliminated without a trace, leaving a world of nothingness. The God of Nothingness came from nothingness to the world created by Leopard God, trying to make everything disappear.
